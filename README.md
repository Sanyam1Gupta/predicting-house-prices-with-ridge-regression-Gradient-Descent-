# Predicting House Prices With Ridge Regression (Gradient Descent)

This project predicts the house sales price using Ridge Regression implemented Gradient Descent.Ridge Regression Performs L2 regularization, i.e. adds penalty equivalent to square of the magnitude of coefficients and after this, achieves the Minimization objective.(This mini-project is a part of ML specialization course, dataset or any pre-trained weights/models used were provided by Coursera.)
